### First step

Compile resources to a python readable format in the two 
directories:

* designer
* icons

Copy back the two python readable files:

* from *designer*, copy ui_combine.py
* from *icons*, qrc_combine2.py and qrc_combine3.py

### Second step

To run **combine-STAGE1.py** enter

* python combine-STAGE1.py

where python is version 2.x or 3.x

### Third step

Continue editing and developing combine-STAGE1.py 
towards combine.py. Then to run **combine.py** enter

* python combine.py

where python is version 2.x or 3.x. It is good fun, is it not?
