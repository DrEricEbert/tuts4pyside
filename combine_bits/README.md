README.md for "combine_bits" section
=====================================

###Introduction

Returning to this work after interruption of several month, I thought it looked like a proverbial ***dog's breakfast***, so we shall try to re-organise it somewhat. 

###Thank you

My sincere gratitude to ***Aaron Richiger***, a guru of PySide who made some valuable suggestions, without ever discouraging. The errors and inadequacies are all mine and mine alone.

###Sequence

It is recommended to run the programs in the following sequence::

    combine-STAGE1.py
    combine.py
    combine_allin1.py
    combine_alter.py

If you quit any time after running combine.py, you will have completed the 
main part of this tutorial.The following two "combine" scripts show  
 alternative strategies of composing main programs.  More detailed 
descriptions follow.

###Under construction

I apologise for the incomplete text.  ak  2013-04-26

###Separation in to subdirectories

The information shared by the each of the method of combining the three parts of the program (***about_box, quit_prog and show_licence***) are in two directories: ***designer*** and ***icons***. The combine.py, combine_alter.py  and the combine_allin1.py will require the data from ***designer*** and ***icons*** directories.  The readme.md in each of these two directories briefly describe what is to be done in each of these.

So the directoy structure is as follows:

combine_bits has the following subdirectories:

icons

designer

combine_folder

combine_alter_folder

combine_allin1_folder
