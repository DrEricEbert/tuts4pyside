readme.md for *designer*
========================

The **combine.ui** is the file generated by the **qt-designer**. To see how it was generated, open combine.ui with the qt-designer. It needs to be converted to a python readable file with the pyside tool **pyside-uic**:
We choose a name for the output file which indicates that it is

* a python file, so it has an extension py
* a user interface data file, so it has a prefix ui_

Thus, the command is 

* **pyside-uic combine.ui -o ui_combine.py** 

**ui_combine.py** should then be copied to other directories as required.
